# Value-accessor

`KitValueAccessor` allows to intercept in communication between html `input` and `ngModel`.


## Why

By default you can't prevent `ngModel` updating, if user inputs new data.


## Scope

* Input components
* Input filters and masks 


## Examples

* collection:autocomplete - [sources](https://github.com/ngx-kit/ngx-kit/tree/master/packages/collection/lib/ui-autocomplete), [demo](http://ngx-kit.com/collection/module/ui-autocomplete)
